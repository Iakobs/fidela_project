# fidela_project

Fidela project is an android game where you drag and drop fruits to customers, but the fruit is generated by a magic triceratops called Fidela, and the customers are all sort of dinosaurs.

This project is the result of the [Make a dinosaur 2](https://itch.io/jam/make-a-dinosaur-2) jam, created by [Rafa Laguna](https://github.com/rafalagoon) amongst others. You can check my entry for the jam in [my itch.io page](https://iakobs.itch.io/triceratops-macedonio).
